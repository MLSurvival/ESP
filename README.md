Name: ESP (Early Stage Prediction) for Longitudinal Data

This code covers both ESP_NB and ESP_TAN algorithms based on the ESP framework presented in PAKDD 2016 paper "Early-Stage Event Prediction for Longitudinal Data".Link of the paper:

The input data file should be in [X,status,time], where 
"X" is the vector of features; 
"status" is 1 if event occures and 0 otherwise;
